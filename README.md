# NeoPixelLightPanel

Custom project for a web controlled NeoPixel light panel. The panel is made up of 8 half meter lengths of 60 pixel/m NeoPixel strips. Each of the 8 strips is controlled from a distinct channel on a Fadecandy board, connected to a RaspberryPi. The Pi runs the node.js app.

This is the API server and the animation backend that talks to the Fadecandy server. The UI is at https://github.com/drybones/neopixel-light-panel-ui
